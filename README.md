<summary>About Datastar</summary>

Datastar is a lightweight hypermedia framework that enables developers to build reactive web applications using simple HTML attributes (`data-*`) and server-side logic. It eliminates the need for complex JavaScript frameworks while providing real-time capabilities, reactive frontend, and multiplayer features out of the box.
